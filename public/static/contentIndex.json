Often the various peoples will depict the gods as a member of their species.\nCommon Lore\nWhen the world was formed the four gods, Imogen the Traveler, Daith the Monarch of War, Systa the Moonlit Dreamer, and Riordan the Iron Maker traveled the world openly, influencing events and partaking in wars directly. A natural balance was struck between them. This balance was shaken with the ascent of Hajimaru, the First Dragon. Shocked by the creation of a new god, the original four met with Hajimaru and came to an accord to establish a new and lasting balance. This balance limited the ways and extent to which the gods could interact with the world as well as removing the ability for new gods to be created the same way as Hajimaru.\nOverview of the Gods\nImogen the Traveler\nOften depicted as a kindly old man wrapped in a cloak and carrying a lantern. Imogen is believed to be kind, gentle, and gregarious. He tends to be associated with travelers, elders, strangers, and inn keepers.\nDaith The Monarch of War\nOften depicted as a woman in armor of gold wielding a spear in one hand and a shield in the other. Daith is believed to be intelligent, but hot headed and stubborn. She tends to be associated with soldiers, knights, mercenaries, and couples.\nSysta the Moonlit Dreamer\nOften depicted as a girl sleeping on or around a crescent moon. Systa is believed to be kind, quiet, and a gentle peace maker. She tends to be associated with children, nature, natural magic, sleep, death, and poison.\nRiordan the Iron Maker\nOften depicted as a muscular man working a forge, carrying a hammer, or holding a horseshoe. Riordan is believed to be tough, focused, and artistic. He tends to be associated with craftsmen, artists, horses, and bee keepers.\nHajimaru the First Dragon\nOriginally named Kenji Wasurete, Hajimaru began life as a commoner who sought immortality through magic. In his pursuit he shed his human form and became the first dragon. He is often depicted as either a a large dragon with grand whiskers, occasionally he is depicted as a dragon with the face of a young man. He is associated with dragons, mages, research, and change.

That array is 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. If you want to randomize your stats (which I recommend trying) roll a d20 for each stat in order and prioritize the stats in the array by their die roll\nAllowed classes, subclasses, and races are in the sheet. For specific information on 3rd party classes, sub classes, and races please reach out to me and I can get you that info. Please note that races not listed in the Lore of the Local Peoples should be reflavored to match one of those listed.\nIgnore racial stat bonuses, every race/subrace gets either +2 to one stat and +1 to another OR +1 to three different stats. Variant humans get either a +2 to one stat or +1 to two different stats and 1 feat. The sheet should handle this for you\nBackgrounds will be simplified to two skill proficiencies, a tool proficiency, and 50 gold (which is already included). Just give a name/profession for your background such as noble, even if you don’t match the proficiencies.\n\nPlease reach out to me if you have questions or are running into issues."},"Resources/Tips-to-Get-the-Most-Out-of-this-Game":{"title":"Tips to Get the Most Out of this Game","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The open table /  west marches  format is a bit different from what we think of as the traditional Dungeons and Dragons campaign. This format is much more player driven and player centric. This can feel more like a world your characters inhabit instead of a book your characters star in. With that in mind here are some tips to get the most out of this game\n\nGive your character a medium term goal and a couple short term goals to pursue\n\nHaving these goals allows for quests to be created in the pursuit of those goals. If you need to, as an example, slay a dragon to create a particular magic item you can reach out to other players to see who would want to join you in that hunt and an adventure can be built around it.\n\n\nTake notes and share them with others\n\nThis can give others a heading to allow them to explore on their own and can help you to remember what you did last time.\n\n\nBe open to exploring the wilds to find new dungeons or adventures\n\nSometimes there can be fun in just exploring the wilds or going for a dungeon crawl. Hex crawls in particular can be a fun source of random fun.\n\n\nPlay with people and characters you haven’t before\n\nThe general idea of an open table is to allow for more frequent and lower prep play. By being open to playing outside of a set group you can get into the adventures you are interested in more frequently and adds a feeling of verisimilitude to the world\n\n\nEmbrace the world as dangerous\n\nBecause this game is meant to be low prep understand that the world can and will be dangerous at points. Knowing this, treat combat not as sport but as war. Set traps, ambush, out number, hire mercenaries, and be ready to run if things don’t work out.\n\n\nBe prepared for characters to die\n\nMuch like the last point, I cannot guarantee your characters make it to retirement. It is ok to mourn them, but be ready to accept their death. If another player loses a character be patient and understanding with them and allow them and their character the moment.\n\n\n"},"Server-Rules":{"title":"Server Rules","links":["Lore/Locations/Cities-and-Towns/Flusstadt"],"tags":[],"content":"\nBe kind and respectful - we are here to have fun. It is ok if the stories take unexpected, or even negative turns\nAt any time feel free to ask others to  pause the action to discuss what is going on and clear up emotions. Please respect such requests.\nPlease keep things PG-13. Fade to black is fine for most things, but if you would be surprised to see it in a Star Wars/ Marvel/ on cable TV then it probably is best handled off screen.\nFor the sake of keeping prep for the game light and to allow groups to form easier adventures may not be tuned for a particular group. For this reason, character death may be more common. It is OK to mourn a character death, but be willing to accept their death if it comes.\nExperience is awarded via gold put away toward a long term goal at a rate of 1 gold to 1 exp. The goal should be worth around 100,000 gold (build a small village, set up a personal castle, starting funds for a revolution/small war etc.)\nCharacters retire at level 12, at which point they achieve their goal, leaving a permanent mark on the world.\nIn-game time catches up to out-of-game time at the end of each adventure.  This means characters will be out of commission for the same length of time as the adventure. So if an adventure takes 2 weeks the characters involved are out of commission for 2 real weeks. However this means that downtime is also captured in real time.\nWhen you initially make a character I suggest making 2 others as backups\nI recommend having a backup level 1 character ready to go at any time just in case your current character falls.\nPlayer vs Player in any form requires consent from both players\nThe starting town of Flusstadt is a safe haven. Very little of interest happens here outside of the sharing of rumors and some shopping.\nUnless another arrangement is made, gold earned will be split into a number of share equal to the total party level, with each player getting a number of shares equal to their level.\n"},"index":{"title":"Welcome","links":["Lore/Locations/Cities-and-Towns/Flusstadt","Server-Rules","Resources/Rules-for-Character-Creation","Resources/House-Rules","Resources/Tips-to-Get-the-Most-Out-of-this-Game","Resources/Handy-Links","Lore/Local-Peoples","Lore/Factions","Lore/Religions","Lore/Locations/Region-Map"],"tags":[],"content":"Hello and welcome to my open table server.
