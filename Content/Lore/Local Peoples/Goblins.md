Goblins of this region often view gold as akin to divinity, to be used primarily in worship. Some goblins are happy maintain the gold they already have while others see it as their duty to "reclaim" all gold for their faith. Goblins who have earned renown are permitted to wear a gold pauldron with a sigil of their choice, often representing their house.
