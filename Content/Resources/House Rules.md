Outside of character creation I am using a few house rules to fit the style of play a bit better. 

## Experience and Leveling
Experience points (XP) are awarded via gold put away toward a long term goal at a rate of 1 gold to 1 exp. The goal should be worth around 100,000 gold. Some examples include:
- Build a small village
- Set up a personal castle
- Starting funds for a revolution/small war
- Develop a unique spell
Further I have adjusted the early experience needed to level to make those levels a bit easier to reach. The progression chart is listed below. 

| Level | XP Needed | Level | XP Needed |
| ----- | --------- | ----- | --------- |
| 1     | 0         | 7     | 23,000    |
| 2     | 200       | 8     | 34,000    |
| 3     | 600       | 9     | 48,000    |
| 4     | 2,000     | 10    | 64,000    |
| 5     | 6,000     | 11    | 85,000    |
| 6     | 14,000    | 12    | 100,000   |
|       |           |       |           |

## Crafting
I am bringing in the crafting system from "Heliana's Guide to Monster Hunting" which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yxih44fJhj7vICSmO3goOqRR0Yi7QaWB/view)

## Time
Time will move at a 1:1 rate when we aren't playing. What this means is that characters out on an adventure may be unavailable for the amount of time they would be away for their adventure. This also means they have plenty of downtime when not adventuring. This would be a good time for characters to craft, do research, work on a skill or any other downtime activity. I am not interested in tracking cost of living so I will assume your characters are making enough to maintain an apartment lifestyle within [[Flusstadt]]
