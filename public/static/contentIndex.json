We will be playing with some slightly modified 5e D&amp;D rules. Here are the basic rules for both the server in general as well as for playing with others.\nServer Rules:\n\nBe kind and respectful - we are here to have fun. It is ok if the stories take unexpected, or even negative turns\nAt any time feel free to ask others to  pause the action to discuss what is going on and clear up emotions. Please respect such requests.\nPlease keep things PG-13. Fade to black is fine for most things, but if you would be surprised to see it in a Star Wars/ Marvel/ on cable TV then it probably is best handled off screen.\nFor the sake of keeping prep for the game light and to allow groups to form easier adventures may not be tuned for a particular group. For this reason, character death may be more common. It is OK to mourn a character death, but be willing to accept their death if it comes.\nExperience is awarded via gold put away toward a long term goal at a rate of 1 gold to 1 exp. The goal should be worth around 100,000 gold (build a small village, set up a personal castle, starting funds for a revolution/small war etc.)\nCharacters retire at level 12, at which point they achieve their goal, leaving a permanent mark on the world.\nIn-game time catches up to out-of-game time at the end of each adventure.  This means characters will be out of commission for the same length of time as the adventure. So if an adventure takes 2 weeks the characters involved are out of commission for 2 real weeks. However this means that downtime is also captured in real time.\nWhen you initially make a character make 2 others as backups\nHave a backup level 1 character ready to go at any time just in case your current character falls.\nPlayer vs Player in any form requires consent from both players\nThe starting town is a safe haven. Very little of interest happens here outside of the sharing of rumors and some shopping.\n"}}
