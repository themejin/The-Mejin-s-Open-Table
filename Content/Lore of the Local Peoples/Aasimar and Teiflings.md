Two halves of the same coin, aasimar and teiflings both show up randomly across all other races. Aasimar are believed to show up as descedants of those who did great and holy works or served a god as part of a pact. People tend to assume aasimar as having a great destiny stemming from this root. Teiflings show up as descendants of those who made deals with a devil or who commit particularly horrendous atrocities. Because of this people tend to be wary of teiflings. It also happens on occasion that twins will be born, one a teifling, and the other an aasimar. The children of either will inherit traits as if the teifling or aasimar were born normally.
