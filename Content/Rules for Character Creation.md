Steps to creating a character for this open table:

1. Make a copy the generic character sheet found here ( [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1moDdlHYGhs6TMqI7ra5S_vj-3YHqOvFCDR66nrB206k/edit#gid=881753006](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1moDdlHYGhs6TMqI7ra5S_vj-3YHqOvFCDR66nrB206k/edit#gid=881753006 "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1moDdlHYGhs6TMqI7ra5S_vj-3YHqOvFCDR66nrB206k/edit#gid=881753006") )
2. Share the character sheet with me (via dm or email themejin@gmail.com) with editing permissions
3. Characters begin at level 1, but also begin with 1 of a number of preselected feats
4. Use standard array for character creation. That array is 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. If you want to randomize your stats (which I recommend trying) roll a d20 for each stat in order and prioritize the stats in the array by their die roll
5. Allowed classes, subclasses, and races are in the sheet. For specific information on 3rd party classes, sub classes, and races please reach out to me and I can get you that info. Please note that races not listed in the [[Lore of the Local Peoples]] should be reflavored to match one of those listed.
6. Ignore racial stat bonuses, every race/subrace gets either +2 to one stat and +1 to another OR +1 to three different stats. Variant humans get either a +2 to one stat or +1 to two different stats and 1 feat. The sheet should handle this for you
7. Backgrounds will be simplified to two skill proficiencies, a tool proficiency, and 50 gold (already included). Just give a name/profession for your background such as noble, even if you don't match the proficiencies.

Please reach out to me if you have questions or are running into issues.
