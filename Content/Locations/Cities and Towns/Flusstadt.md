## The Basics
The starting town for our adventures. With the researchers opening up the gates of "The Academy" recently the town has seen a surge in travelers, researchers, and craftsmen. With this surge comes an increase in quests of all varieties. 

Flusstadt has merchants and trades people of almost every stripe, so if there are non-magical items you seek you can probably find them here for the usual going rate.

## Adventures
While adventure surrounds Flusstadt, the town itself is a safe haven, so any adventures will take you out of town proper. If you are looking for trouble you will not find it in ***this*** town. Despite that the number of people coming and going means work can always be found for an adventurer, and the proximity to the academy means that the dungeon is always available to explore.
