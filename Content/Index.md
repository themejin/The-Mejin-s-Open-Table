Hello and welcome to my open table server. We will be playing with some slightly modified [5e D&D rules](https://media.wizards.com/2018/dnd/downloads/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf). Here are the basic rules for both the server in general as well as for playing with others.

Server Rules:
- Be kind and respectful - we are here to have fun. It is ok if the stories take unexpected, or even negative turns
- At any time feel free to ask others to  pause the action to discuss what is going on and clear up emotions. Please respect such requests.
- Please keep things PG-13. Fade to black is fine for most things, but if you would be surprised to see it in a Star Wars/ Marvel/ on cable TV then it probably is best handled off screen.
- For the sake of keeping prep for the game light and to allow groups to form easier adventures may not be tuned for a particular group. For this reason, character death may be more common. It is OK to mourn a character death, but be willing to accept their death if it comes.
- Experience is awarded via gold put away toward a long term goal at a rate of 1 gold to 1 exp. The goal should be worth around 100,000 gold (build a small village, set up a personal castle, starting funds for a revolution/small war etc.)
- Characters retire at level 12, at which point they achieve their goal, leaving a permanent mark on the world.
- In-game time catches up to out-of-game time at the end of each adventure.  This means characters will be out of commission for the same length of time as the adventure. So if an adventure takes 2 weeks the characters involved are out of commission for 2 real weeks. However this means that downtime is also captured in real time.
- When you initially make a character I suggest making 2 others as backups
- I recommend having a backup level 1 character ready to go at any time just in case your current character falls.
- Player vs Player in any form requires consent from both players
- The starting town of [[Flusstadt]] is a safe haven. Very little of interest happens here outside of the sharing of rumors and some shopping.
- Unless another arrangement is made, gold earned will be split into a number of share equal to the total party level, with each player getting a number of shares equal to their level.
