Sometimes working under the pseudonym “Plush Skies”, the thieves guild helps connect thieves and burglars with each other and with fences. They have branches in most major cities and enforce an honor among thieves mindset. They are generally anti-violence so crimes that begin loud and result in major loss of life can get members banned or shunned. 

  

Goals:

- Long Term Vague - Make money via guild fees
- Long Term - Expand influence and safety through bribes and elevating politicians who are in on the cut
	- Medium Term - Track down a spy in their network
	- Short Term - Recruit a team of newbies for some easier scores
